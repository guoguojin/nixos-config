# NixOS Config

This repo contains my setup for managing machine builds for NixOS using Nix flakes.

Inspiration has come from [Mathias Benaets](https://github.com/MatthiasBenaets/nixos-config) and 
his [YouTube video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGVXJ-TIv3Y) on how to install and configure 
a NixOS system, and how to use Home Manager and Nix Flakes. While it's a long tutorial, it's definitely
worth spending the time as it goes into a lot of detail and explains a lot of things about Nix and NixOS.
